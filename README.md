## ![](./iphoneTunnel-logo.png)  iPhoneTunnel for Mac 

[iPhone Tunnel 2.3 PE (Python Edition) BETA release!](./downloads/iPhoneTunnel2.3-beta1.zip)

_From orginal front page_ 

Instructions:
Press "Turn Tunnel On" in the menu item.
Select your desired tool from the "Tools" area.
Done!

Set the desired ports (> 1024) and any other settings in preferences. (Default: 22 remote and 2222 local)
If something doesn't work, check if the checkbox next to "Debug mode" is enabled! (Otherwise it won't work! Check the issues.) (Fixed!)

Enjoy!

This is a crude implementation of the usbmuxd python library from Héctor Martín Cantero @ http://marcansoft.com/blog/iphonelinux/usbmuxd/ .
It is (mostly) thanks to him that we can SSH over USB to our iTouch-devices on a Mac for the newer iTunes and firmware versions, so be nice and say "Thanks"!

This needs some more work to become user-friendly and a lot more to be considered elegant.
However, it does work and all the "Tools" seem to work (though I didn't test tethering).

Help is greatly appreciated. Check the issues, check out the source, build it, drop us (me or novi) a note or a patch or two.
